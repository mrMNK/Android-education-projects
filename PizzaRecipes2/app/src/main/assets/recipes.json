      "recipe": "STEP 1\nMake the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.\n\nSTEP 2\nMake the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.\n\nSTEP 3\nRoll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.\n\nSTEP 4\nTop and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza."

Toss the red onion with the red wine vinegar and a good pinch of salt and set aside (the vinegar will soften the onion slightly, which is a blessing as no one wants completely raw onion on pizza).\n\nSTEP 2\nPut the naan breads on a baking tray, sprinkle over a little water, then put in the oven for 2 mins to heat up. Meanwhile, put the chicken and peppers in a frying pan with the curry paste, toss together, then fry over a high heat for 6-8 mins until cooked.\n\nSTEP 3\nTake the naans out the oven, spread each one with yogurt, then top with the chicken, red onion, green chilli, coriander and mango chutney."

      "recipe": "STEP 1\nHeat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Remove the leaves from the cauliflower and trim the stalk end, then cut into chunks. Blitz half the cauliflower in a food processor until finely chopped, like rice. Transfer to a bowl and repeat with the remaining half. Tip all the cauliflower in a bowl, cover with cling film and microwave on High for 5-6 mins until softened. Tip onto a clean tea towel and leave to cool a little. Once cool enough to handle, scrunch up the tea towel and squeeze as much liquid as you can out of the cauliflower, then transfer to a clean bowl. Stir in the ground almonds, egg, oregano and plenty of seasoning. Line a baking tray with baking parchment and grease with oil. Mound the cauliflower mix into the centre of the tray, then use a spoon and your hands to spread out into a 30cm round. Make it a little thicker at the edges to create a ‘crust’. Bake for 15-18 mins until golden brown and starting to crisp a little at the edges.\n\nSTEP 2\nMeanwhile, heat a griddle pan, brush each aubergine slice on both sides with a little of the oil, season and cook for 5-6 mins, turning once, until softened and charred – you’ll need to do this in batches. Transfer to a plate. Brush the onions with oil, season and griddle for 5-8 mins until softened and charred. To make the tomato sauce, whizz the canned tomatoes, tomato purée, garlic and some seasoning in a blender until smooth. Transfer to a small saucepan, bring to a simmer and cook gently for 8-10 mins until thick (you don’t want any watery tomato soaking into the cauliflower base). Tear half the basil leaves and stir through the sauce.\n\nSTEP 3\nOnce the cauliflower base is cooked, set aside to cool a little. Turn the oven up to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Drain the mozzarella and pat dry with kitchen paper. Spread the tomato sauce over the base, sprinkle over the Grana Padano, then arrange the aubergines, red onion and mozzarella on top. Scatter over the chilli flakes and return to the oven for 10-12 mins. Before serving, shave over a little more cheese and scatter with the remaining basil leaves."

      "recipe": "STEP 1\nPut the lardons into a large, cold, non-stick frying pan and turn the heat on low. Cook the lardons very gently, stirring occasionally, until the fat has melted into the pan and they are beginning to brown and crisp. Use a slotted spoon to lift the bacon into a mixing bowl and set aside, but keep all the fat in the pan.\n\nSTEP 2\nAdd the onions, oil and 2 thyme sprigs. Cook over a low heat for 20-25 mins until the onions are softened and beginning to turn golden. Stir in the sugar and cook over a higher heat for 5 mins more until golden brown. Tip into the bowl with the lardons and set aside to cool.\n\nSTEP 3\nWhen the onions are just about cool, tip the bread mix into another mixing bowl with leaves stripped from 1 thyme sprig, and make up following pack instructions, but don’t knead or rise. Scatter the semolina, polenta or flour over a 30 x 40cm shallow tin or baking tray, and roll out the dough to fit it. Season the ricotta with 1 tsp salt and some pepper, and spread over the dough, leaving a small border. Mix the egg and Gruyère into the onion mixture with seasoning, then spread over the ricotta. Scatter with remaining thyme. Open-freeze for 2 hrs, then wrap well in cling film and freeze for up to 3 months. Or heat oven to 200C/ 180C fan/gas 6 to bake straight away.\n\nSTEP 4\nCook for 40 mins until base is crisp and golden, then eat warm or cool, sliced into pieces with a green salad. To bake from frozen, heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3 and bake for 30 mins, then increase temp to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 for 15-20 mins."
